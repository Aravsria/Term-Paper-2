Here's the simulate data script. We're supposed to modify it as per our polling data. Can you help me write out something for the contents of this script.

Generated by DALL·E
To help you modify the simulation script (00-simulate_data.R) to fit your polling data, I'll outline some key modifications based on the common steps for generating simulated polling data. Here’s how you can approach it:

Key Modifications for the Script:
Loading the Required Libraries and Data

Load necessary libraries such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2.
Read the actual polling data (president_polls.csv) to understand the structure (e.g., columns for pollster, date, sample size, candidate support, etc.).
R
Copy code
# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Read the actual polling data
polling_data <- read.csv("data/president_polls.csv")
Define Simulation Parameters

Set up the parameters for the simulation, such as the number of simulations, sample sizes, and the distribution of support for each candidate.
For example, you could simulate polling data for two main candidates (Candidate A and Candidate B) using beta distributions to represent variability in polling support.
R
Copy code
# Define simulation parameters
num_simulations <- 1000
candidates <- c("Candidate_A", "Candidate_B")
population_size <- 1000000 # Total population for simulation purposes
sample_sizes <- sample(500:3000, num_simulations, replace = TRUE) # Randomly select sample sizes for each simulation
Simulate Polling Support

Use a probabilistic model to simulate polling results for each candidate. A beta distribution can be used for proportions, as it allows for variability in support.
If the actual polling data shows average support for Candidate A as 0.52, you can set up the beta distribution accordingly.
R
Copy code
# Simulate polling data for each candidate
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  simulation_id = 1:num_simulations,
  sample_size = sample_sizes,
  Candidate_A_support = rbeta(num_simulations, shape1 = 52, shape2 = 48), # Shape parameters are based on 52% support for Candidate A
  Candidate_B_support = rbeta(num_simulations, shape1 = 48, shape2 = 52)  # Shape parameters for 48% support for Candidate B
)

# Normalize the data so that support adds up to 1
simulated_data <- simulated_data %>%
  mutate(total_support = Candidate_A_support + Candidate_B_support,
         Candidate_A_support = Candidate_A_support / total_support,
         Candidate_B_support = Candidate_B_support / total_support)
Incorporate Non-Response and Bias

Simulate potential non-response bias or other factors based on actual polling characteristics. For instance, you might adjust support based on sample demographics or regional factors if present in your data.
R
Copy code
# Introduce non-response bias
simulated_data <- simulated_data %>%
  mutate(Candidate_A_support = ifelse(runif(num_simulations) < 0.1, Candidate_A_support * 1.05, Candidate_A_support), # 10% chance of bias increasing support by 5%
         Candidate_B_support = 1 - Candidate_A_support)
Add Pollster-Specific Effects

If you have data on different pollsters, add variability in simulated results to reflect differences in polling methodologies. This could be modeled as a random effect.
R
Copy code
# Assuming pollster data is available in the original dataset
pollsters <- unique(polling_data$pollster)
simulated_data$pollster <- sample(pollsters, num_simulations, replace = TRUE)

# Add a small random effect for each pollster
pollster_effect <- rnorm(length(pollsters), mean = 0, sd = 0.02) # Small random effect with mean 0 and SD 0.02
names(pollster_effect) <- pollsters

simulated_data <- simulated_data %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(Candidate_A_support = Candidate_A_support + pollster_effect[pollster],
         Candidate_A_support = pmin(pmax(Candidate_A_support, 0), 1), # Ensure values are between 0 and 1
         Candidate_B_support = 1 - Candidate_A_support)
Save the Simulated Data

Save the simulated dataset to the data folder for further analysis.
R
Copy code
# Save the simulated data
write.csv(simulated_data, "data/simulated_polls.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Summary
The modified script should:

Load the raw polling data.
Define simulation parameters based on actual data characteristics.
Simulate polling support using probabilistic models.
Incorporate factors like non-response, bias, and pollster-specific effects.
Save the simulated data for analysis.
This approach aligns the simulated data closer to real polling conditions, helping you create a realistic forecasting model. Let me know if you need help with any specific part or further adjustments!

here's the test simulate data script. It has a bunch of random stuff in it right now. Add content so that it's in line with the data we simulated.

Generated by DALL·E
To align the content of your 01-test_simulated_data.R script with the simulated data, we'll set up tests that validate key aspects of the simulated dataset, ensuring consistency and correctness. Here are some suggested tests you can include:

1. Test if the Simulated Data Exists and Has the Expected Structure
Verify that the simulated_data object is available and contains the expected columns: simulation_id, Candidate_A_support, Candidate_B_support, and any other columns you may have added.
R
Copy code
# Load the simulated data
simulated_data <- read.csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_data.csv")

# Test if the data has been loaded successfully
stopifnot(!is.null(simulated_data))

# Check that the expected columns are present
expected_columns <- c("simulation_id", "Candidate_A_support", "Candidate_B_support")
stopifnot(all(expected_columns %in% colnames(simulated_data)))
2. Test for Data Types
Ensure that each column in the dataset has the correct data type.
R
Copy code
# Test data types
stopifnot(is.numeric(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support))
stopifnot(is.numeric(simulated_data$Candidate_B_support))
stopifnot(is.integer(simulated_data$simulation_id))
3. Test if the Simulated Support Values are Between 0 and 1
Since support proportions should be within the range [0, 1], check if all values are in this range.
R
Copy code
# Test if support values are within the range [0, 1]
stopifnot(all(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support >= 0 & simulated_data$Candidate_A_support <= 1))
stopifnot(all(simulated_data$Candidate_B_support >= 0 & simulated_data$Candidate_B_support <= 1))
4. Test if the Support Values Sum Up to 1
Ensure that the support for both candidates in each simulation sums up to approximately 1.
R
Copy code
# Test if the sum of support for both candidates is approximately 1
tolerance <- 0.01
stopifnot(all(abs(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support + simulated_data$Candidate_B_support - 1) < tolerance))
5. Test for Unique Simulation IDs
Confirm that the simulation_id values are unique.
R
Copy code
# Test for unique simulation IDs
stopifnot(length(unique(simulated_data$simulation_id)) == nrow(simulated_data))
6. Test for Reasonable Distribution (Optional)
If you have an expected distribution (e.g., mean support around 0.5 for each candidate), you can test if the mean and variance are within reasonable bounds.
R
Copy code
# Test if the average support for Candidate A is reasonable (e.g., around 0.5)
mean_candidate_A <- mean(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support)
stopifnot(mean_candidate_A > 0.4 & mean_candidate_A < 0.6)

# Test if the variance is not zero (indicating variation in the data)
var_candidate_A <- var(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support)
stopifnot(var_candidate_A > 0)
7. Check for Pollster-Specific Effects (If Applicable)
If you added a pollster column or other effects, test that these effects were incorporated properly.
R
Copy code
# If pollster information is present, ensure no missing values
if ("pollster" %in% colnames(simulated_data)) {
  stopifnot(!any(is.na(simulated_data$pollster)))
}
Putting It All Together
Here’s a complete script incorporating the above tests:

R
Copy code
# Load the simulated data
simulated_data <- read.csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_data.csv")

# Test if the data has been loaded successfully
stopifnot(!is.null(simulated_data))

# Check that the expected columns are present
expected_columns <- c("simulation_id", "Candidate_A_support", "Candidate_B_support")
stopifnot(all(expected_columns %in% colnames(simulated_data)))

# Test data types
stopifnot(is.numeric(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support))
stopifnot(is.numeric(simulated_data$Candidate_B_support))
stopifnot(is.integer(simulated_data$simulation_id))

# Test if support values are within the range [0, 1]
stopifnot(all(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support >= 0 & simulated_data$Candidate_A_support <= 1))
stopifnot(all(simulated_data$Candidate_B_support >= 0 & simulated_data$Candidate_B_support <= 1))

# Test if the sum of support for both candidates is approximately 1
tolerance <- 0.01
stopifnot(all(abs(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support + simulated_data$Candidate_B_support - 1) < tolerance))

# Test for unique simulation IDs
stopifnot(length(unique(simulated_data$simulation_id)) == nrow(simulated_data))

# Test if the average support for Candidate A is reasonable (e.g., around 0.5)
mean_candidate_A <- mean(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support)
stopifnot(mean_candidate_A > 0.4 & mean_candidate_A < 0.6)

# Test if the variance is not zero (indicating variation in the data)
var_candidate_A <- var(simulated_data$Candidate_A_support)
stopifnot(var_candidate_A > 0)

# If pollster information is present, ensure no missing values
if ("pollster" %in% colnames(simulated_data)) {
  stopifnot(!any(is.na(simulated_data$pollster)))
}

cat("All tests passed successfully!\n")
These tests will help ensure that your simulated data is structured correctly and follows the expected characteristics. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
