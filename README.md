# 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Forecast

## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation for their own projects associated with *Telling Stories with Data*. You do not need every aspect for every paper and you should delete aspects that you do not need.

This repository contains the code and data used to complete forecast the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. It was created by Arav Sri Agarwal and Uma Sadhwani. This forecast was executed by using Presidential polling data from FiveThirtyEight. The forecast employs the poll-of-polls method and Bayesian modeling.

## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from FiveThirtyEight.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned datasets that were constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data, along with the script used for building the models.


## Statement on LLM usage

This project utilized Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Perplexity.ai and ChatGPT, to aid in the generation of code. ChatGPT was consulted during the creation of all of the scripts, the literature component, abstract and introduction. The entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
